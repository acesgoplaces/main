# ACES TWO by ACES Go Places
A group of 3 ex-Home Team NSFs who are passionate in improving the shit that is named ACES.

### Problem Statement
Currently, SCDF receives 995 calls from concerned callers who are usually far away from the incident location or are passing by in moving vehicles. 
This means that SCDF is unable to pinpoint the exact incident location to our ground officers attending to these cases. 
This results in a loss of precious time, where those few minutes in finding out the exact location of the fire, or the subject threatening to jump might mean life and death.

## ACES TWO
### How it works? (Architecture)
ACES TWO uses a separate webpage to pull important data from the caller's phone.
Such important data include Date and Time, current GPS location and orientation of the phone, which helps SCDF to create a proper timeline of the case file onto ACES, rather than having our 995 Dispatchers manually typing out as is the current situation. This frees up our 995 Dispatchers to do more important tasks like triaging
